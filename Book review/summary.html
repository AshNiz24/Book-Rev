        <p>
        CERN director Maximilian Kohler discovers one of the facility's top physicists, Leonardo Vetra, murdered, his chest branded 
        with an ambigram of the word "Illuminati." Kohler contacts Robert Langdon, an expert on the Illuminati, who determines that 
        the ambigram is authentic. Kohler calls Vetra's adopted daughter Vittoria home and it is ascertained that the Illuminati, 
        an ancient anti-religious organization thought extinct, have stolen a canister containing antimatter, a substance with 
        destructive potential comparable to a nuclear weapon. When at CERN, the canister is stored in a unique electrical charger 
        which ensures the antimatter's stability, but when removed, its backup battery provides power for 24 hours, after which the
         antimatter would fall out of suspension and, on coming into contact with the physical matter of the container, explode. 
         The canister is located somewhere in Vatican City, with a security camera in front of it, as its digital clock counts down
          to an explosion due to occur at midnight, which will wipe out the Vatican.
    </p>
    <p>
        Langdon is initially convinced that the Illuminati cannot be responsible for two reasons: 1) the Illuminati went extinct 
        centuries ago, and their remnants were absorbed into the Freemasons and 2) the Illuminati, as men of scientific truth, would 
        never sanction the murder of a fellow scientist. Kohler explains that Vetra might be an exception, as he was also an ordained 
        Catholic priest.
        
        Langdon and Vittoria make their way to Vatican City, where the Pope has recently died. They are told that the four Preferiti, 
        the cardinals who are most likely to be elected pope, are missing. Langdon and Vittoria search for the preferiti in hopes that 
        they will also find the antimatter canister. Their search is assisted by Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca (the late pope's closest 
        aide), the Vatican's Swiss Guard and Commander Olivetti.

        Langdon tells Vittoria how the Illuminati created a citywide map known as the "Path of Illumination," a trail once used by the
         Illuminati as a means of inducting new members; aspirants who wanted to join the Illuminati were required to follow a series
          of subtle clues left in various churches in and around Rome. The clues indicate the secret meeting place of the Illuminati. 
          Langdon's theory is that the Path was marked by sculptures created by a mysterious Illuminati artist: an Illuminati member 
          placed as a mole within the Vatican itself. Langdon is granted access to the Vatican Archives by the camerlengo, where he 
          believes a document containing the clues to the Path of Illumination is located. The clues to the Illuminati markers are 
          placed inside Galileo's famous book called 'Diagramma.' Langdon then sets off on the Path of Illumination in hopes of saving
           the preferiti and recovering the antimatter canister.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Path leads Langdon and Vittoria to four churches in Rome, each one containing works of art by Baroque artist Gian Lorenzo 
        Bernini (who Langdon realizes is the Illuminati artist) depicting angels and associated with one of the primordial elements: 
        Earth, Air, Fire and Water. Langdon realizes the four preferiti will be murdered in a way thematically related to each 
        location's related element. The first cardinal is branded with an Earth ambigram and has soil forced down his throat, 
        suffocating him; the second is branded with an Air ambigram and has his lungs punctured; the third is branded with a Fire 
        ambigram and is burned alive; and the fourth is branded with a Water ambigram and is wrapped in chains and left to drown at 
        the bottom of a fountain.
    </p>
    <p>
        During their search for the Illuminati lair, Langdon and Vittoria are seen getting closer. After finding the bodies of the 
        first two preferiti, Langdon hurries to the Santa Maria della Victoria Basilica and finds the preferiti's abductor in the 
        act of setting the third cardinal on fire. The kidnapper is an unnamed assassin who is working under the orders of the 
        Illuminati master "Janus," whose true identity is unknown. Commander Olivetti is killed and the assassin kidnaps Vittoria. 
        Langdon escapes and accosts the assassin at the final element's marker (Water) but he is unable to save the cardinal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Langdon must complete the Path of Illumination in order to find the assassin and rescue Vittoria. His search leads him to 
        Castel Sant'Angelo which he realizes is the "Church of Illumination," the Illuminati's secret lair. Under the papal fortress 
        is a tunnel which leads directly into the pope's private library in the Vatican. Langdon frees Vittoria and together they send 
        the assassin falling several hundred feet to his death. The two hurry back to St. Peter's Basilica, where they find that Kohler
         has arrived to confront the camerlengo in private. Langdon and Vittoria fear that Kohler is Janus and that he has come to 
         murder the camerlengo. Hearing the camerlengo scream in agony from being branded with the Illuminati Diamond (a symbol 
         combining all four Illuminati ambigrams), the Swiss Guards burst into the room and open fire on Kohler. Just before he dies, 
         Kohler gives Langdon a mini video camera containing a video Kohler made while confronting the camerlengo and tells him to 
         give it to the media.
