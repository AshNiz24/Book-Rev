            Daniel Gerhard Brown (born June 22, 1964) is an American author best known for his thriller novels, 
            including the Robert Langdon novels Angels & Demons (2000), The Da Vinci Code (2003), The Lost Symbol (2009), 
            Inferno (2013) and Origin (2017). His novels are treasure hunts that usually take place over a period of 24 hours. 
            They feature recurring themes of cryptography, art, and conspiracy theories. His books have been translated into 57 languages 
            and, as of 2012, have sold over 200 million copies. Three of them, Angels & Demons, The Da Vinci Code, and Inferno, have been 
            adapted into films.

            In 1996 Brown quit teaching to become a full-time writer. Digital Fortress was published in 1998. His wife, Blythe, 
            did much of the book's promotion, writing press releases, booking Brown on talk shows, and setting up press interviews. 
            A few months later, Brown and his wife released The Bald Book, another humor book. It was officially credited to his 
            wife, though a representative of the publisher said that it was primarily written by Brown. Brown subsequently wrote 
            Angels & Demons and Deception Point, released in 2000 and 2001 respectively, the former of which was the first to 
            feature the lead character, Harvard symbology expert Robert Langdon. Brown's first three novels had little success, 
            with fewer than 10,000 copies in each of their first printings. His fourth novel, The Da Vinci Code, became a bestseller, 
            going to the top of the New York Times Best Seller list during its first week of release in 2003. It is one of the most 
            popular books of all time, with 81 million copies sold worldwide as of 2009. Its success has helped push sales 
            of Brown's earlier books.

            Characters in Brown's books are often named after real people in his life. Robert Langdon is named after John Langdon, 
            the artist who created the ambigrams used for the Angels & Demons CD and novel. Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca is named after
             On a Claire Day cartoonist friend Carla Ventresca. In the Vatican archives, Langdon recalls a wedding of two people named 
             Dick and Connie, which are the names of his parents. Robert Langdon's editor Jonas Faukman is named after Brown's real 
             life editor Jason Kaufman. Brown also said that characters were based on a New Hampshire librarian, and a French teacher 
             at Exeter, Andr√© Vernet. Cardinal Aldo Baggia, in Angels & Demons, is named after Aldo Baggia, instructor of modern 
             languages at Phillips Exeter Academy.
