            When Dan Brown published his fourth novel, "The Da Vinci Code," in 2003, it was an instant bestseller. It boasted a fascinating protagonist, a Harvard professor of religious iconography named Robert Langdon, and compelling conspiracy theories. Brown, it seemed, had come out of nowhere.

            But the bestseller actually had precursors, including "Angels and Demons," the first book in the Robert Langdon series. Published in 2000 by Simon & Schuster, the 713-page turner takes place chronologically before "The Da Vinci Code," although it doesn't really matter which you read first. Dan Brown as usual has come up with this epic novel which instantly was a best-seller and people who were interested in conspiracy theories have given it a 5-star rating.
            
            Both books revolve around conspiracies within the Catholic church, but most of the action in "Angels and Demons" takes place in Rome and the Vatican. As of 2018, Brown has written three more books in the Robert Langdon saga, "The Lost Symbol" (2009), "Inferno" (2013), and "Origin" (2017). All but "The Lost Symbol" and "Origin" have been made into films starring Tom Hanks.

                <p>
                The book opens with the murder of a physicist working for the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Switzerland. An ambigram representing the word "Illuminati," referring to a centuries-old secret society, has been branded onto the victim's chest. In addition, the director of CERN soon learns that a canister filled with a type of matter that has the destructive power equal to a nuclear bomb has been stolen from CERN and hidden somewhere in Vatican City. The director calls in Robert Langdon, an expert on archaic religious symbolism, to help unravel the various clues and find the canister.

            What follows is a fast-paced thriller focused on Langdon's attempts to discover who is pulling the strings within the Illuminati and how far their influence goes. It's major themes are religion versus science, skepticism versus faith, and the hold that powerful people and institutions have over the people they supposedly serve.
